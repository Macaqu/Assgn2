/**
 * A locomotive is a railway carriage with the ability to propel itself and pull (or push) other carriages. Thus the primary distinguishing characteristic of a locomotive is how much weight it can pull.
 *
 * However, calculating the total amount of weight a locomotive can move depends on how much "tractive force" it can generate, which in turn depends on the raw horsepower of the engine, the amount of friction between the train's wheels and the track, the track's grade, and whether we are referring to the "starting" force or the "continuous" force. (As anyone who has ever pushed a stalled car knows, it takes much more effort to get a vehicle moving than to keep it moving once it is already in motion.)
 *
 *  Therefore, to keep things simple, most railway operators use a system of discrete "classification codes" to describe how powerful a locomotive is. For our purposes we adopt a model similar to that used by various UK regional railways in which locomotives are classified by a two-character code:
 *
 * A numeric "power class" in the range 1 to 9.
 * An alphabetic "engine type" consisting of either "E" for electric, "D" for diesel or "S" for steam.
 * For instance, a locomotive with classification code "4S" is a steam engine in power class 4.
 *
 * To determine how much weight a locomotive can move, we shall use a simple formula in which the maximum weight the locomotive can pull, in tonnes, is its power class times 100.
 * For instance, a locomotive with classification "4S" can pull at most 4 X 100 = 400 tonnes.
 * NB: This figure includes the weight of the locomotive itself.
 * Thus a locomotive classified as only "1D" which weighs 180 tonnes cannot move!
